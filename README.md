# Cypress-API-Automation
Using Cypress.io to automate the testing of a dummy REST API (https://gorest.co.in/). These files test:
- Creating a new employee record
- Deleting an existing employee record
- Updating an existing employee record
- Viewing all the records

  How to get this running on your machine?
  - Fork the repo to your local machine
  - Run 'npm install' and it will install all the packages and dependencies
  - Run 'npx cypress run'
  - You'll see the tests run successfully!
 
    Let's collaborate!
